# blazor-games

This repository is an experiment with using Blazor WebAssembly by building some simple games.

The app is deployed to a Github page [here](https://yarhamjohn.github.io/blazor-games/). ![Github Page](https://github.com/yarhamjohn/blazor-games/workflows/gh-pages/badge.svg?branch=main)

Currently there is only one game, an implementation of Minesweeper.
